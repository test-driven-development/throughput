    Before beginning, let each participant choose a magic marker and give each participant 2 pieces of blank white paper.
    
    The Simulation
    
    Now, tell the participants they have 2 minutes to draw two faces: 1 face on one white sheet and another face on another white sheet.
    Everyone will draw these faces by themselves using their magic marker.
    As soon as everyone has completed this task (or when 2 minutes is up), ask everyone to form pairs.
    It helps if participants pair with people they aren't best friends with, but you can let participants decide with whom to pair.
    Once the pairs have formed, have each pair find a comfortable place where they will be able to draw together.
    Each pair should have 2 different color magic markers: So if Jon and Jane pair, they can't both have blue markers.
    Pairs should use colors that are different in hue (not green and light green) so that it will be easy to see which participant contributed what to each drawing.
    Give each pair 2 sheets of blank white paper (or you can have them all work on a white board) and ask them to PairDraw a human face (one face per sheet of paper).
    When every pair has completed drawing 2 human faces, the entire group can assemble for the debrief.
