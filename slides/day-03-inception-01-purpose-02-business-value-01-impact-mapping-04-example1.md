The map illustrates a milestone of an online gaming platform. The key business goal for this milestone is to increase the number of active players to 1 million.

Players are important actors. They can help by recommending games to their friends, posting about the games on Facebook or inviting friends directly.

Another group of important actors are advertisers. They can also bring players by publishing adverts.

There are several deliverables that can impact player behaviour. For example, semi-automated invites can help make invitations more straightforward, a more personalised experience will make it more likely that players will invite friends, and reaching new levels or achievements should motivate players to post about the games on social networks.  </p>
